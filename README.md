# javascript_introduction

Hello World, this is day 7 of The Odin Project! Today I will be doing some JavaScript.

I have decided to take less notes from now on as everything is available on the internet 
and I have never seen myself refrence back to my notes. JavaScript shouldn't be hard to learn since I already know C++ and Java.

See you tomorrow!
